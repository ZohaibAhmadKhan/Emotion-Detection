# Emotion-Detection
This repository contains computer code and dataset information for our manuscript "Emotion Detection" under review at PEERJ computer science. 
The datasets used in this study were sourced from two primary repositories. The "EMOTHAW" dataset was obtained from [10], (https://www.psicologia.unicampania.it/the-lab/our-activities) and the "SemEval"  dataset was acquired from [25], (https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools), as referred in the manuscript. 

These datasets serve as valuable resources for our research, and we acknowledge their contributions to our work.
